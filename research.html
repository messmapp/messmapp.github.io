							<p>
								Azzollini et al.
								<blockquote>
									Context. The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still a matter of debate, 
									and the sources that originate them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei (AGN) 
									have gained increasing attention in recent years. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their capability of accelerating 
									particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest that they may play a role in the production 
									of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory.<br>
									Aims. We studied the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars, that have been proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, 
									based on a positional cross-correlation statistical analysis between IceCube hotspots and the Fifth Edition of the Roma BZCat catalog. 
									We provide a first characterization of their central engines and inner physical nature, which may help to explore the potential 
									link with neutrino production.<br>
									Methods. This study carries out an analysis of the optical spectroscopic properties of a sample of 52 candidate neutrino-emitter 
									blazars, to infer their accretion regime. It is complemented by data at the radio and gamma-ray frequencies, which carry the information 
									about the intrinsic power of the relativistic jet. We compared the properties of the sample of candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to 
									other blazar samples from the literature. To this end, we performed statistical tests and also explored, through simulations, the 
									applicability of methods that include limits (censored data) on the quantities of our interest.<br>
									Results. Overall, the sample of candidate neutrino-emitter blazars displays properties compatible with those of the reference 
									samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields (which are typical of radiatively efficient accretors), 
									and high radio power, such as high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). Among the blazars in our sample, 24 are detected in gamma-rays; 
									they cover various ranges of γ-ray luminosities, compatible with the overall population. Additionally, we show that the statistical 
									tests commonly used in the literature need to be used with caution, as they are highly sensitive to the amount of censored data 
									and the sample size.

							<p>
								Sanchez Zaballa et al.
								<blockquote>
									X-ray observations are essential for understanding the multimessenger emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Blazars, 
									a subset of AGN whose X-ray emission predominantly originates from relativistic jets, have been proposed as promising high-energy 
									neutrino sources. In this work, we study the candidate neutrino-emitting blazar 5BZB J0630-2406, which has been observed over multiple 
									epochs with the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Neil Gehrels Swift-XRT, and eROSITA observatories. Analysis of the X-ray spectra in the 2.0-10.0 keV 
									band shows significant variability, with high-flux states adhering to a power-law model indicative of jet emission. However, during low-flux 
									states, the spectrum reveals an additional component in hard X-rays, indicating a transition from jet-dominated to multicomponent X-ray 
									emission, possibly associated with hadronic processes. To investigate this spectral evolution, we tested various models and found it to be 
									consistent with coronal emission or photoionized absorption processes typically observed in obscured AGN. The identification of the X-ray 
									spectral variability in 5BZB J0630-2406, combined with its potential for neutrino production, opens new perspectives in multimessenger 
									astrophysics of blazars, highlighting the synergies between the mechanisms of the jet and the nuclear environment.

							<p>
								KM3NeT collaboration, MessMapp Group et al.
								<blockquote>
									The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of ~ 220 PeV, 
									the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3° radius centred at RA 94.3°, 
									Dec -7.8° (J2000). High-energy astrophysical neutrinos are a crucial messenger for understanding hadronic acceleration processes 
									in the Universe and for identifying the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Among the most powerful cosmic accelerators, blazars 
									are proposed as promising neutrino sources. A sample of seventeen candidate blazars located in this region is selected through 
									their multiwavelength properties, and studied using archival data and dedicated observations. One of the candidate counterparts 
									exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate 
									counterpart exhibits a rising trend in the X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time. A third candidate undergoes 
									a gamma-ray flare during the same period. While none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of 
									a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.

							<p>
								KM3NeT collaboration et al.
								<blockquote>
									The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena. 
									Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: 
									their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, 
									and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea, 
									which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of 120(+110,-60) petaelectronvolts (PeV). 
									In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. 
									The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. 
									This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.

							<p>
								Clairfontaine et al.
								<blockquote>
									Recent observations are shedding light on the important role that active galactic nuclei play in the production of high-energy neutrinos. 
									In this study, we focus on one object, 5BZB J0630-2406, which is among the blazars recently proposed as associated with neutrino emission 
									during the first 7 yr of IceCube observations. Modeling the quasi-simultaneous, broadband spectral energy distribution, we explore various 
									scenarios from purely leptonic to leptohadronic models, testing the inclusion of external photon fields. This theoretical study provides a 
									complementary testing ground for the proposed neutrino-blazar association. Despite being historically classified as a BL Lac, our study shows 
									that 5BZB J0630-2406 belongs to the relatively rare subclass of high-power flat-spectrum radio quasars. Our results indicate that interactions 
									between protons and external radiation fields can produce a neutrino flux that is within the reach of the IceCube detector. Furthermore, the 
									spectral shape of the X-ray emission suggests the imprint of hadronic processes related to very energetic protons.

							<p>
								Buson et al. 2023
								<blockquote>
									Identifying the astrophysical sources responsible for the high-energy cosmic neutrinos has been a longstanding challenge.
									In a previous work, we report evidence for a spatial correlation between blazars from the 5th Roma-BZCat catalog and neutrino
									data of the highest detectable energies, i.e. &#62 0.1 PeV, collected by the IceCube Observatory in the southern celestial hemisphere.
									The statistical significance is found at the level of 2 x 10^{-6} post-trial. In this work we test whether a similar correlation
									exists in the northern hemisphere, were IceCube is mostly sensitive to &#60 0.1 PeV energies. We find a consistent correlation
									between blazars and northern neutrino data at the pre-trial p-value of 5.12 x 10^{-4}, and a post-trial chance probability
									of 6.79 x 10^{-3}. Combining the post-trial probabilities observed for the southern and northern experiments yields a global
									post-trial chance probability of 2.59 x 10^{-7} for the genuineness of such correlation. This implies that the spatial correlation
									is highly unlikely to arise by chance. Our studies push forward an all-sky subset of 52 objects as highly likely PeVatron extragalactic accelerators.

							<p>
								Buson et al. 2022, ApJL , 933, 4
								<blockquote>
									Neutrinos are the most elusive particles in the universe, capable of traveling nearly unimpeded across it.
									Despite the vast amount of data collected, a long-standing and unsolved issue is still the association of
									high-energy neutrinos with the astrophysical sources that originate them. Among the candidate sources of
									neutrinos, there are blazars, a class of extragalactic sources powered by supermassive black holes that
									feed highly relativistic jets, pointed toward Earth. Previous studies appear controversial, with several
									efforts claiming a tentative link between high-energy neutrino events and individual blazars, and others
									putting into question such relation. In this work, we show that blazars are unambiguously associated with
									high-energy astrophysical neutrinos at an unprecedented level of confidence, i.e., a chance probability
									of 2 × 10^{−6}. Our statistical analysis provides the observational evidence that blazars are astrophysical
									neutrino factories and hence, extragalactic cosmic-ray accelerators.
